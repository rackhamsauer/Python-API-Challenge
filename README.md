# Python-API-Challenge
This challenge focused on doing an analysis of weather, humidity, temperature, wind speed and location. Determining different humidity values in particular. Then the analysis branched into locating areas with higher humidity values and plotting them on a map. Then we took that information and used it to decide on areas of a vacation. Specifically filtering out data that did not meet the criteria I set, cooler than 100 deg, warmer than 50, less than 10mph of wind and low humidity. Once I filtered that data then I used geoapify to determine hotels that were within 10000 meters of the city location. I identified those and then graphed them. I used previous lessons, other students, chat gpt, stack overflow, and api documentation to complete this assigmenet.
